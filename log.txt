25/06/2018 - Started reading a book on memory power by Dominic O'Brien. Book seems useful. Learnt about arrow function in JS, then about classes and prototypal inheritance. Also learnt about using this keyword with call(), apply() and bind(). Rest it was all about funtions. Also learnt about focus, tabindex, using taborder for accesibility.
Then using __proto__, object creation with functions and global scope and function scope.
